  "conferenceOverview": "GbR is a biennial workshop organized by the 15th Technical Committee of IAPR, aimed at encouraging research works in Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis within the graph theory framework. The 11th edition will be held in Anacapri, on the island of Capri (Italy), from May 16 to May 18, 2017. This workshop series traditionally provides a forum for presenting and discussing research results and applications in the intersection of pattern recognition, image analysis on one side and graph theory on the other side. In addition, given the avenue of new structural/graphical models and structural criteria for solving computer vision problems, GbR2017 organization encourages researchers in this more general context to actively participate in the workshop. Furthermore, the application of graphs to pattern recognition problems in other fields like computational topology, graphic recognition systems and bioinformatics is also highly welcome at the workshop. The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS) series.",
